    "\n",
    "The gamma-ray burst GRB031332 produces a flux of $8 \\times 10^{-10}$ Watts per square\n",
    "meter on Earth, for a period of about 90 seconds.  A followup measurement shows\n",
    "that the burst occurred about 3000 Megaparsecs away.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) What was the luminosity of this gamma-ray burst?  How much energy did the\n",
    "explosion produce during the $90$-second burst period?\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) How does that luminosity compare to that of the entire Milky Way galaxy?\n",
    "Remember that the Sun's luminosity is about $4 \\times 10^{26}$ Watts.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) The energy released by a supernova explosion is about $10^{44}$ Joules.\n",
    "About how many times more energy was released by this gamma-ray burst?\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1.2 What could produce a burst of energy as powerful as GRB031332?\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) If two neutron stars, each twice the mass of the Sun, fell toward\n",
    "each other and collided, how much gravitational potential energy would \n",
    "be released?  How does this compare with the energy released by GRB031332?\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Would it be possible for a burst of energy of this size to be\n",
    "released if ordinary stars or diffuse gas totaling 2 times the mass\n",
    "of the Sun fell onto a 2-solar-mass neutron star?  Explain\n",
    "your reasoning."
