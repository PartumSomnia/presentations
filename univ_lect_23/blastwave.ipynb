    "# Dynamics of a transrelativsitic blastwave\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you (with my help) will derive a set of ODEs that describe the dynamical evolution of a transrelativistc blastwave. Later, you will implement this system in code (python is recommended, but I can also check C/C++ implementation should you wish to take a harder path).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will compute the bolometric light curve from this blastwave by using an extremely simplified model of radiation. The goal of this task is to get familiar with the foundation a modern semi-analytic afterglow model. The model is based on the paper by [Nava+2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.2806.pdf) which is short and very well written and is highly recommended for this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will not attempt to compute synchrotron radiation accurately or to integrate the radiation over the emitting region  taking into account the time-of-flight effect (e.g., the equal-arrival time surface integration). These are interesting tasks, but they require significantly more physics (in the case of radiation) or programming (in the case of EATS integration). So, we focus on the blastwave itself. The inerested reader is encouraged to check the textbook by [Zhang 2018](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781139226530) and references therein. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to skim though the book, you find that the model we deirve here is somewhat different from most models used in the past. This is becase we omit making certain assumptions that, while significantly simplifing the equations, lead to the violation of the energy conservation. In other words, our model will be significantly more accurate than most models on the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise is split into two main chapters with an increasing level of difficulty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first chapter you are asked to follow the derivation of the BW dynamics, complete them, and implement them in code (you will have the correct equations to proof-check yourself, but I will need to see your derivations leading up to these equations). \n",
    "Then you will be asked to run your simulations, plot the result and check whether the total energy in the blastwave is indeed conserved.  \n",
    "In the last part of the chapter, you will add radiation, compute and plot luminocity and discuss the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second (optional) chapter, should you wish to get the highest grade, you will attempt to significantly alter the derivations done in the first chapter to include additional physics following [Nava+2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.2806.pdf) paper. If you succeed, and/or have a strong interest in GRB afterglow phyics, we can consider a scientific research project that would lead to a publication(s). "

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several way to model GRB afterglow. Perhaps the most accurate one is to perform a numerical, relativsitic hydrodynamics simulation of the outflow and then couple it with sychrotron radiation transport model to compute observed emission. However, this is approach is (i) complex (ii) numerically expensive (iii) still relies on many simplifying assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we will try to model the GRB afterglow semi-analytically. This means constructing a set of ODEs that describe the time-evolution of the fluid element that includes the shock, and then computing the luminocity of this shock. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is so-called \"thin-shell\" approximation. It is based on the observation made on the basis of aforementioned numerical hydrodynamics simulations that the fastest and thus the most energetic fluid in a jet forms a thin shell that propagates throgh the circumburst medium (CBM). Within this shell, there is a forward shock propagating into the CBM, the contact discontinuity, and the reverse shock propagating back into the ejecta. By assuming that this shell is sufficnetly small, it is possible to write the energy consdervation equations in a form of ODEs that desctibe how the properties of the shocks evolve. \n",
    "Specifically we assume the following \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first and second exercise we focus only on the forward shock. This is equivalent to saying that the reverse shock is either not relevant or has alrady crossed the entire ejecta shell and we can neglect it. In the last **optional** exerciese you can try to include the reverse shock into the model following provided paper. This is a significant increase in model complexity. However, if you understood how we derive we construct the model for the forward shock only, (_which is based on the same paper, but significantly expanded to fill-in the blanks_) you will be able to follow that paper and include the reverse shock as well. By doing so you will create an afterglow model that is by far more advanced than most of the currenly avalable models used in most advanced multimessenger pipelines. "
