    "\n",
    "Finally, you will compute the bolometric light curve from this blastwave by using an extremely simplified model of radiation. The goal of this task is to get familiar with the foundation of a modern semi-analytic afterglow model. The model is based on the paper by [Nava+2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.2806.pdf) which is short and very well written and is highly recommended for this exercise. \n",

    "We will not attempt to compute synchrotron radiation accurately or to integrate the radiation over the emitting region taking into account the time-of-flight effect (e.g., the equal-arrival time surface (EATS) integration). These are interesting tasks, but they require significantly more physics (in the case of radiation) or programming (in the case of EATS integration). So, we focus on the blastwave itself. The interested reader is encouraged to check the textbook by [Zhang 2018](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781139226530) and the references therein. \n",

In other words, our model will be significantly more accurate than most models on the market. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the **first chapter**, you will follow a detailed  derivation of the BW dynamics, complete it, and implement it in code (you will have the correct set of equations to proof-check yourself, but I will need to see your derivations leading up to these equations).  \n",

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to model GRB afterglow. Perhaps the most accurate one is to perform a numerical, relativistic hydrodynamics simulation of the outflow and then couple it to the synchrotron radiation transport model to compute observed emission. However, this approach is (i) complex (ii) numerically expensive (iii) still relies on many simplifying assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, you will try to model the GRB afterglow semi-analytically. This means constructing a set of ODEs that describe the dynamical evolution of a single fluid element, the blastwave, and then computing the luminosity as a function of the BW parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a so-called \"thin-shell\" approximation. It is based on the fact that the fastest and thus the most energetic fluid in a jet forms a thin shell that propagates through the circumburst medium (CBM). Within this shell, there is a forward shock propagating into the CBM, the contact discontinuity, and the reverse shock propagating back into the ejecta. By assuming that this shell is sufficiently small, it is possible to write the energy conservation equations in the form of ODEs that describe how the properties of the shocks evolve. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first chapter, we focus only on the forward shock. This is equivalent to saying that the reverse shock is either not relevant or has already crossed the entire ejecta shell and we can neglect it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second optional chapter, you will try to include the reverse shock into the model following provided paper. This is a significant increase in model complexity. However, if you understood how we derive and construct the model for the forward shock only, you will be able to follow that paper and include the reverse shock as well. By doing so you will create an afterglow model that is by far more advanced than most of the currently available models used in most advanced multimessenger pipelines. \n"
